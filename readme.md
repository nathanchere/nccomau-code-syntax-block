# Server-Side Code Syntax Highlighting Block for WordPress 5.x

A WordPress plugin which extends Gutenberg by adding *server-side* syntax highlighting to the WordPress core code block. Forked from [westonruter's fork](https://github.com/westonruter/code-syntax-block) of [code-syntax-block](https://github.com/mkaz/code-syntax-block) with changes to suit my own needs for my blog at nathanchere.com.au

### Changes from upstream

* Adds support for updating from GitHub through https://github.com/afragen/github-updater
* Adds support for languages I care about (e.g. Elixir, C#) and drops support for those I don't
* Remove plugin-level translation/internationalisation support
