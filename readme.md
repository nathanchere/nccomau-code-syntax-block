# Server-Side Code Syntax Highlighting Block for WordPress 5.x

A WordPress plugin which extends Gutenberg by adding _server-side_ syntax highlighting to the WordPress core code block. Forked from [westonruter's fork](https://github.com/westonruter/code-syntax-block) of [code-syntax-block](https://github.com/mkaz/code-syntax-block) with changes to suit my own needs for my blog at nathanchere.com.au

### Changes from upstream

### Changelog

#### 1.0.1

- Adds syntax highlighting support for languages I care about (e.g. Elixir, C#) and drops support for those I don't
- Remove plugin-level translation/internationalisation support

#### 1.0.0

- Forked from westonruter/code-syntax-block (commit 3df16d2d)
- Adds support for updating from GitHub through https://github.com/afragen/github-updater

### Roadmap

#### Realisticic

- Code block caption
- Configure supported languages through UI without editing plugin code
- Add support for a default theme

#### Not likely to happen but nice to think about

- Line numbers
